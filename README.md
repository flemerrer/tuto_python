This is a simple project I've worked on to learn Python. 

It is the result of following Entwanne's Python tutorial from Zeste de Savoir without looking at the provided solutions.

My objective here was to try and solve problems by myself while learning Python. 
It is not perfect, by far, but I've learned much about the language structure and inner workings.  

If you happen to be reading this, I welcome any remarks on this project.
